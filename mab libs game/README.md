To play the Mad Libs game, start by compiling and running the program. The game will prompt you to provide various types of words, such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives. As you enter these words, they are stored in variables and used to fill in the blanks of a predefined story template. Once you have provided all the required words, the game combines them with the template to generate a humorous and unique story. This game demonstrates several fundamental concepts in C programming: it uses variables to manage user input and placeholders, input/output functions like printf() and scanf() to interact with the user, and string manipulation techniques to assemble the final story.
